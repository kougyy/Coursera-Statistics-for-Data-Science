Charles River Properties:\n   - Properties near Charles River have significantly different values (p=0.0000)\n   - River properties: $19.90k vs. Non-river: $21.65k\n\n2. Age of Properties:\n   - Significant difference in property values based on age (p=0.0000)\n   - 0-25% built before 1940: $25.85k\n   - 26-50% built before 1940: $23.41k\n   - 51-75% built before 1940: $23.69k\n   - 76-100% built before 1940: $18.49k\n\n3. Business Acres vs. Nitric Oxide:\n   - Strong relationship exists (r²=0.4529, p=0.0000)\n   - Higher business concentration correlates with higher pollution levels\n\n4. Distance to Employment Centers:\n   - Each additional distance unit increases home values by $0.83k\n   - This relationship is statistically significant\n==========================================\n",
